I've started my career in 2015 and since then have been working in both web and windows software development, database systems and reporting. I love to solve problems and am passionate about finding ways for improving the development workflow of where I'm working.

Currently, I'm finishing a masters program in Computer Engineering with a focus on machine learning and high-performance computation.
